- Background color: Dark Gray (#1F2937), which emphasizes the nodes and edges in the 3D space. In RGB hex it is #1F2937.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#A78BFA) for interactive elements and highlights, adding subtle visual interest. In RGB hex it is #A78BFA.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clear and modern readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Maintain a clean, structured layout with panels on the sides and top, using the full screen for the 3D graph.
- Subtle animations for node selection and graph updates to enhance user experience without overwhelming.
- Use a minimal set of clear, outlined icons from a consistent set. Preferably use the heroicons set.
